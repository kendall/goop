A Standard Process is established to be performed in the context of projects, configuring a Project Standard Process (such as a standard Development Process), in the context of an organization, configuring an Organizational Standard Process (such as a standard Portfolio Management Process), or can be applicable to both contexts, configuring a Hybrid Standard Process (such as a standard Training Process).
