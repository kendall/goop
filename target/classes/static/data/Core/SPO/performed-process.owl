They typically are the processes or activities executed in a project or organization by some agent. A Performed Process can occur in a Project, configuring a Project Performed Process (such as a performed Design Process), or in the context of an Organization, configuring an Organizational Performed Process (such as a performed Recruitment Process).
A Performed Process can be general or specific. A General Performed Process is composed of two or more Specific Performed Processes (e.g. a Development Process can be composed of Requirements, Design, Construction and Test Processes). Specific Performed Processes are composed of two or more Performed Activities. A Performed Activity, analogously, can be simple or composite. A Composite Performed Activity is composed of other Performed Activities; a Simple Performed Activity is an atomic action that cannot be decomposed into smaller activities. Performed Activities can also depend on other Performed Activities (e.g. a Review activity that depends on a Documentation activity)."""^^rdfs:Literal .
